In the world of Linux, we often rely on powerful command-line tools like [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) for image manipulation. However, sometimes a graphical user interface (GUI) is just more convenient, especially for quick, one-off tasks. In this post, we'll explore how I built a sleek, standalone **Image Resizer** application using `customTkinter` and `Pillow`.

# The Goal
The objective was simple: create a lightweight desktop application that allows users to:
1.  Select an image from their local machine.
2.  View its current dimensions.
3.  Specify a new width and height.
4.  Choose a specific resampling (interpolation) algorithm for high-quality resizing.
5.  Save the result in a desired format.

# Implementation Details

## 1. The Modern UI
Standard `tkinter` apps often look dated on modern Linux desktop environments. `CustomTkinter` solves this by offering rounded corners, better colors, and high-DPI support out of the box.

The main application logic is encapsulated in the `ImageResizerApp` class. We use a grid layout to organize the UI into three main sections:
*   **File Selection:** A frame containing the file chooser and current file info.
*   **Settings:** Inputs for width, height, and a dropdown for the interpolation method.
*   **Action:** A prominent "Resize & Save" button.

```python
# Setting the theme is as simple as:
ctk.set_appearance_mode("System")
ctk.set_default_color_theme("blue")
```

## 2. Handling Images with Pillow
When a user selects an image, we open it using `Image.open()` to immediately extract and display its dimensions. This provides immediate feedback, allowing the user to know the starting aspect ratio.

```python
with Image.open(path) as img:
    self.image_original = img.copy()
    # Pre-fill entry fields with current dimensions
    self.entry_width.insert(0, str(img.width))
    self.entry_height.insert(0, str(img.height))
```

## 3. Resampling Algorithms
One key feature of this app is the ability to choose the *resampling method*. Naive resizing can lead to pixelation or blurriness. We expose several filters provided by Pillow:

*   **NEAREST:** Fast but pixelated.
*   **BOX:** Fast image downsampling.
*   **HAMMING:** Good for image downsampling and produce better results than `BOX` method.
*   **BILINEAR:** Smooths out pixels.
*   **BICUBIC:** Uses cubic interpolation (often a good default).
*   **LANCZOS:** High-quality downsampling filter.

Mapping these UI choices to Pillow constants was straightforward:

```python
method_map = {
    "LANCZOS": Image.Resampling.LANCZOS,
    "BICUBIC": Image.Resampling.BICUBIC,
    # ... other methods
}
```

# Packaging for Distribution

A Python script is great for developers, but end-users just want an executable. Using `PyInstaller`, we can bundle the interpreter and all dependencies into a single file.

The `<python_file>.spec` file (generated by PyInstaller) defines how the build process handles imports and hidden dependencies. The final build command (likely managed via a task runner or simple shell script) produces a binary in the `dist/` folder that can be run on any compatible Linux machine without installing Python or libraries manually.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates how quickly one can spin up a useful, good-looking desktop utility using Python. `CustomTkinter` bridges the gap between the simplicity of `tkinter` and modern design expectations, while `Pillow` handles the heavy lifting of image processing.

Future improvements could include:
*   **Maintain Aspect Ratio:** A checkbox to automatically calculate height based on width.
*   **Batch Processing:** Resizing multiple images at once.
*   **Drag & Drop:** Support for dragging files directly into the window.
